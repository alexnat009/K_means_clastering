# K_means_clastering

Assume we have city A. There have been a crime outbreak<br>
and for the past 5 years police have been trying<br>
to locate the optimal location for the night crews.<br>
Let points on X-Y plane be crime locations, then <br>
using K-means clustering we need to find optimal<br>
centers for locating police.<br>
